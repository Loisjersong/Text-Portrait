    <p>You and me we made a vow
      For better or for worse
      I can't believe you let me down
      But the proof is in the way it hurts
      For months on end I've had my doubts
      Denying every tear
      I wish this would be over now
      But I know that I still need you here
      You say I'm crazy
      'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
      But when you call me baby
      I know I'm not the only one
      You've been so unavailable
      Now sadly I know why
      Your heart is unobtainable
      Even though Lord knows you kept mine
      You say I'm crazy
      'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
      But when you call me baby
      I know I'm not the only one
      I have loved you for many years
      Maybe I am just not enough
      You've made me realize my deepest fear
      By lying and tearing us up
      You say I'm crazy
      'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

  For months on end I've had my doubts
  Denying every tear
  I wish this would be over now
  But I know that I still need you here
  You say I'm crazy
  'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
  But when you call me baby
  I know I'm not the only one
  You've been so unavailable
  Now sadly I know why
  Your heart is unobtainable
  Even though Lord knows you kept mine
  You say I'm crazy
  'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
  But when you call me baby
  I know I'm not the only one
  I have loved you for many years
  Maybe I am just not enough
  You've made me realize my deepest fear
  By lying and tearing us up
  You say I'm crazy

  For better or for worse
  I can't believe you let me down

  Maybe I am just not enough
  You've made me realize my deepest fear
  By lying and tearing us up
  You say I'm crazy
  'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

  For better or for worse
  I can't believe you let me down
  But the proof is in the way it hurts

  You say I'm crazy
  'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
  But when you call me baby
  I know I'm not the only one

  Now sadly I know why
  Your heart is unobtainable
  Even though Lord knows you kept mine
  You say I'm crazy

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know
And I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one
You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now

'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know, and I know, and I know
And I know, and I know, and I know, know
I know I'm not the only one
You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
